## Contribution Notice

Thank you for your interest in this Project Euler repository. This project was undertaken independently, and the code reflects the solutions as they were at the time of completion. While I appreciate the enthusiasm to contribute and optimize, I would like to maintain this repository as a personal showcase of my progress and coding style during the challenges.

Feel free to explore and gain insights, but I kindly request that you refrain from submitting contributions or pull requests. If you have questions or suggestions, I'd be happy to discuss them through other means mentioned in the "Contact" section.

Thank you for your understanding!
